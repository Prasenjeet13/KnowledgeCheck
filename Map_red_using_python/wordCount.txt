In this MapReduce tutorial, we are going to learn the concept of a key-value pair in Hadoop. The key Value pair is the record entity that MapReduce job receives for execution. By default, RecordReader uses TextInputFormat for converting data into a key-value pair. Here we will learn what is a key-value pair in MapReduce, how key-value pairs are generated in Hadoop using InputSplit and RecordReader and on what basis generation of key-value pairs in Hadoop MapReduce takes place? We will also see Hadoop key-value pair example in this tutorial.
